The fire event / fire drill will be randomly hosted by the owners, and the fire alarm will be activated by them. When the program starts, please follow these procedures:

1. Close all self-checkouts and manual checkouts.
2. Evacuate everyone from the building.
3. Check the restrooms to ensure there is nobody inside; if there is, ask them to evacuate.
4. Conduct a quick sweep of the area to make sure no one is left behind.

After completing these steps, please go outside and meet with management. Failure to follow this procedure will result in punishment.
