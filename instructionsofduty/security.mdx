  </Step>
  <Step title="Definition of Thief">
    When customers leave the store and the EAS Gate sounds or VOCOVO indicates "Zone: 1 | Alarm," and the customer's nametag shows "STEALING," they are considered to be a thief.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Cuff the Thief">
    When you identify a thief, equip your handcuff and cuff them by pressing **"C"**. Bring them back to the cashier **self-service checkout area** and uncuff them by pressing **"C"** again.

    You **must inform**  the stealers that they need to **pay before leaving the store**.

    If necessary, specify the number of products they stole using the [Inventory Search Tool](https://bloxnshop.gitbook.io/docs/staff/5-or-instructions-of-duty/5.4-or-instructions-for-security-duty#instructions-for-using-the-inventory-search-tool). If they are using a basket or trolley, instruct them to unload the items for payment.

  </Step>
  <Step title="If the behaviour continues...">
    If the thief continues to steal items or trolling the EAS Gate, issue a informal warning to stop. If the behavior continues, please issue a formal warning.
